## Authorship Verification for Plagiarism Detection

### Project Description

This is a prototype for plagiarism detection system to be created and evaluated. Basically, the system will detect if an essay is submitted by student’s own work and from previous student’s work to make sure they are improving their vocabulary and sentence structure. The instructor will see the student’s essay and compare to their previous essay. Also, will grade the student’s essay and comment to the student’s essay to the student, so they can improve more in their life. The essay will be stored in the student’s account so they can look over for future class in case they forgot how to do their techniques for the essay’s class. The system can allow student to submit their work depending on the instructor submission whatever if it can be submit it once or unlimited times. The server application will load student’s essay, stored the student’s work, submit the student’s work, create assignments and manage the class while separating the student’s work, grade the assignment, and comment the assignment for student to learn and grow in their future life using it by the user interface. This project will help student from university who are writing the essay for some class they need to take it now or in the future class that involves with it.

#### Problem Domain Book

The topics within our problem domain are English literature, plagiarism, and statistics. Literature knowledge is important for making informed decisions about the authenticity of a document that don't just come from the statistics we gather. Plagiarism is also something that we need to understand, not just what it is and how to detect it but also public opinion about plagiarism. Statistics are incredibly important to understand as we need to leverage statistics when verifying the author of a document.
